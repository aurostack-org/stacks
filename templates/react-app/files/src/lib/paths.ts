 * project has to compile in *every* feature combination, and only one of two
 * declarations of the same name can survive the strip. Drop `marketing` and only
 * the leading empty segment is left, putting the app back at the root.
 *
 * The `''` is not filler: an absolute path's first segment *is* empty —
 * `'/app'.split('/')` is `['', 'app']`. It also keeps this array non-empty in
 * every build, which matters because a literal that strips down to `[\n]` is no
 * longer formatted the way Prettier wants it, and `format:check` runs in CI.
